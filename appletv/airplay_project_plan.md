# airplay_project_plan.md

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements an AirPlay receiver application that emulates an Apple TV device. The system is designed to run on **Ubuntu Server 24.04**, deployed in a **VM within Proxmox 8.4**. The application allows an **iPhone 16 Pro (iOS 16)** to discover it over AirPlay, stream video/audio content to it, and exposes a **web interface** for:

‚úÖ Real-time display of the AirPlay stream in a browser.  
‚úÖ Starting/stopping recording of the incoming stream into `.mp4` files.  
‚úÖ Browsing, playing, and downloading recorded videos.  

All components will run as **separate Docker containers** orchestrated by Docker Compose.

## üñ• System Architecture

### Components

1. **AirPlay Receiver (UxPlay):**
   - Acts as a virtual Apple TV.
   - Discovers iPhones over mDNS (Bonjour) using **Avahi**.
   - Decodes video/audio streams received from iOS devices.
   - Based on [UxPlay](https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay), a mature open-source AirPlay implementation for Unix systems.

2. **Media Transcoder (FFmpeg):**
   - Captures the framebuffer video and loopback audio output from UxPlay.
   - Streams video to the frontend in real-time using **MJPEG** (preferred for low latency in browsers, especially Chrome on macOS).
   - Records incoming streams into `.mp4` files on disk.
   - Reference: [FFmpeg Documentation](https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html)

3. **Web Backend (API):**
   - Provides a REST API for frontend to control recording and fetch metadata.
   - Serves the live stream and recorded media.
   - Manages FFmpeg processes.

4. **Web Frontend (UI):**
   - React single-page application (React is preferred for this project).
   - Displays the live stream.
   - Provides controls for recording and browsing past recordings.

## üì° API Specification

### `POST /api/record/start`

- **Description:** Start recording the current AirPlay stream.  
- **Request Body (JSON):**

  }
  ```
- **Errors:**
  - 409 Conflict: "Recording already in progress."
  - 500 Internal Server Error: "Failed to start recording."

      "duration": 90.0,
      "createdAt": "2025-07-16T10:12:00Z"
    }
  ]
  ```

### Authentication

- **Authentication is not required** for this project.  
- Both API and web UI are designed to be accessible without any login or authorization.  

---

## üé® UI/UX Design

### Live Stream Page
- Video player showing the AirPlay stream.  
- Record toggle button:
  - Label: "Start Recording" ‚Üí "Stop Recording".
  - Recording indicator (red dot) when active.  
- Link to **Gallery** page.

### Gallery Page
- List of recorded files:
  - Filename, duration, size.  
  - Play button to watch inline.  
  - Download button.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling & Edge Cases

- If FFmpeg fails to start:
  - API returns 500 error with message "FFmpeg process failed."
  - Log the exact command and error output.
- If disk space is low:
  - Reject new recording requests with 507 Insufficient Storage.
- If multiple iPhones connect:
  - **Support only one AirPlay stream at a time.**
  - Return 409 Conflict if a second stream is attempted.
- **No automatic cleanup of old files:** if storage is full, the system will return an error.

---

## üìú Logging Requirements

- Log all key operations in structured JSON format. Example:
  ```json
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-07-15T20:45:00Z",
    "level": "info",
    "event": "recording_started",
    "filename": "airplay-20250715-204500.mp4"
  }
  ```
- Levels: info, warning, error, debug.  
- Log AirPlay connections/disconnections, API calls, and FFmpeg errors.  
- All logs and UI must be in **English only**.

---

## ‚ö° Scalability

- **Support only one AirPlay stream at a time.**  
- No multi-stream support is planned in the initial version.

---

## ‚öô Backend Language

- **Preferred:** Go (using Gin framework).  

---

## üìú API Documentation

- No OpenAPI/Swagger spec is required.  
- API documentation will be maintained in the project README.  

---

## üóÇ Dockerized Architecture

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  airplay:
    build: ./airplay
    network_mode: host
    devices:
      - "/dev/fb0:/dev/fb0"
      - "/dev/snd:/dev/snd"
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus"
      - "/var/run/avahi-daemon/socket:/var/run/avahi-daemon/socket"
      - "airplay-records:/var/airplay-records"
    restart: unless-stopped

  web:
    build: ./web
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - "airplay-records:/var/airplay-records"
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  airplay-records:
```

---

## üìÇ Deployment Script Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Stopping and cleaning up Docker..."
docker-compose down
docker system prune -af
docker volume prune -f

echo "Installing host dependencies..."
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y avahi-daemon ffmpeg docker-compose
sudo modprobe snd_aloop

echo "Rebuilding and starting containers..."
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

## üõ† Simplifications & Decisions

- **AirPlay Receiver (UxPlay):** launched as a standalone process inside the container; no custom wrapper needed.  
- **AirPlay 2:** not supported; only basic mirroring (video/audio).  
- **Media Transcoder (FFmpeg):** captures `/dev/fb0` for video and `snd_aloop` for audio; no direct integration with UxPlay. No auto-restart logic for FFmpeg; API returns an error if FFmpeg crashes.  
- **Web Backend (API):** built with **Gin** framework in Go. Files stored locally in Docker volume; no external storage integration (e.g., S3).  
- **Web Frontend (React):** live stream uses standard `<video>` tag with MJPEG. Simple responsive design for mobile devices.  
- **Docker & Deployment:** only **x86_64** supported; no ARM builds. Hardcoded paths and ports for simplicity.  
- **Logging:** logs written to stdout/stderr only (Docker best practice). No external logging systems or rotation.  
- **Testing:** no automated tests; manual testing with iPhone.  
- **Security:** no authentication/authorization; system is fully open in the local network.  
- **Multi-stream Handling:** rejects additional connections with 409 Conflict; simple error shown in UI.  
- **Future Extensions:** none planned; project is intended as a personal, lightweight solution.

## üß† Cursor Development Guidelines (MCP Usage)

This project is developed using **Cursor IDE**. When solving tasks, generating code, or planning architecture in this repository, **Cursor must apply the following model context protocols (MCPs):**

### ‚úÖ Sequential Thinking MCP
- **When to use:**  
  - For any task that involves complex reasoning, multi-step planning, or architectural decisions.  
  - For features that span across multiple components or require advanced analysis.  
- **Instruction for Cursor:**  
  - Always use the `sequential-thinking` MCP server to break down tasks into small, manageable sub-tasks.  
  - This ensures modular code generation and avoids large, hard-to-debug files.  
- **MCP Server Configuration:**  
  ```json
  {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
  }
  ```

---

### üìö Context7 MCP
- **When to use:**  
  - When integrating with external APIs, tools, or libraries (e.g., UxPlay, FFmpeg, Avahi, Docker, React).  
  - When looking up the latest documentation or code examples.  
- **Instruction for Cursor:**  
  - Use `context7` to fetch and study relevant documentation before writing code.  
- **MCP Server Configuration:**  
  ```json
  {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
  }
  ```

---

### üìù Development Rules for Cursor

- Always follow the architecture and design in **`airplay_project_plan.md`**.  
- Break down **every task into small sub-tasks** to ensure modular, testable code.  
- Avoid generating large files; prefer small, focused modules.  
- The backend is written in **Go**, frontend in **React**, and all API, logs, and UI text are **English-only**.  
- The system does not require authentication or security measures, as it is intended for private LAN usage.
